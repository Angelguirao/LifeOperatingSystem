# LifeOS ‚Äì Your Intelligent Life Operating System

LifeOS is an open-source, AI-powered personal digital companion inspired by Gordon Bell's pioneering *MyLifeBits* project. It seamlessly captures, integrates, analyzes, and visualizes personal data‚Äîtransforming everyday experiences into meaningful insights and connections.

> "There's something deeply universal and human that leads every engineer to eventually conclude: 'I need to serialize my life as an event stream dataset.'"

LifeOS is built on that impulse: to structure the chaos, debug existence, and turn raw, messy life into something searchable, queryable, replayable‚Äîmaybe even beautiful.


## üåë On the Uncomputable

> "LifeOS is not just a system for computing life‚Äîit's a system for testing the limits of what **cannot** be computed."

While LifeOS structures thoughts, logs events, and links ideas through semantic AI and databases, it also recognizes the existence of **uncomputable dimensions** of life.

Inspired by philosophical critiques of computation, LifeOS holds space for:

- **Analog life** ‚Äî embodied sensations, moods, images, sounds
- **Rational paradox** ‚Äî ideas that contradict themselves or exceed logic
- **Practical limits** ‚Äî ambiguity, context collapse, missing data
- **Indeterminacy** ‚Äî entropy, chaos, affect, intuition, randomness

Rather than ignoring these, LifeOS tries to **interface with them**. Through free-form journaling, emotional metadata, fuzzy AI linking, and time-based transitions, LifeOS allows *the unstructured and uncertain* to coexist alongside structured data.

**This is not just software.**  
It's a **mirror** for self-awareness, and a **canvas** for lived experience‚Äîquantized, yes, but also messy, poetic, and irreducibly human.

Let LifeOS be a memory system.  
Let it also be an experiment in meaning.  
In what can be computed‚Äîand what always escapes.

## üåç Project Vision

LifeOS is not just a digital repository‚Äîit's an **intelligent compass** that enhances self-awareness, encourages reflection, and helps users actively manage life's complexity.

Through **AI, semantic graph relationships, and rich contextual metadata**, LifeOS becomes a *living knowledge network* that grows with you.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Multi-Modal Life Capture**  
  Events, thoughts, actions, states, interactions, documents, chats, photos, and sensor data‚Äîall stored with rich metadata.

- **File Upload & Storage**  
  Upload eBooks, documents, images, audio, and link them to meaningful moments using S3-compatible storage (e.g., Supabase Storage, AWS S3, R2).

- **AI-Powered Insight Engine**  
  Using OpenAI + Pinecone, LifeOS generates summaries, detects patterns, and suggests associative links between moments and ideas.

- **Dynamic Knowledge Graph**  
  Events and objects (people, tools, places, ideas) are linked via typed, semantically meaningful relationships using Neo4j.

- **Custom Visualizations**  
  Navigate your timeline, emotion flows, and idea webs via D3.js, Chart.js, and intelligent graph views.

- **Rich Contextual Modeling**  
  Each event can track emotion, energy, attention, source (sensor/manual/AI), and be connected to sessions or threads.

- **Privacy & Persona Layers**  
  Define granular privacy scopes (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer) for data sharing and intelligent persona modeling.

- **Secure & Compliant**  
  End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256), GDPR-ready, and designed for future self-hosted sovereignty.


## üß† Architecture Overview

LifeOS is built as a **modular system** with a **hybrid database model**, **clean backend architecture**, and optional future support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.


### **Entity Storage**
| Data Type | Storage |
|-----------|---------|
| Structured Objects (Users, People, Documents, Tags) | **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)** |
| Flexible Event Stream (Thoughts, Metrics, Actions) | **MongoDB** |
| Typed Relationships (caused_by, inspired_by, reflects_on) | **Neo4j** |
| AI Embeddings & Semantic Search | **Pinecone** |

### üß¨ Database Schema

### üìä Data Model Philosophy

LifeOS builds upon the vision of *MyLifeBits*, but introduces several core evolutions:

| Feature                  | **LifeOS**                                                   | **MyLifeBits**                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Unit**            | `event` (lived experience, journaled, contextual)            | `resource` (file or media artifact)           |
| **Schema Flexibility**   | Dynamic payloads per event type                              | Typed relational tables                        |
| **Relationships**        | Typed, directional, with metadata (cause, reflection, etc.)  | Predefined bidirectional links                 |
| **Narrative Modeling**   | Supports attention threads, transitions, sessions            | Collection-based groupings                     |
| **Graph Backbone**       | Neo4j-backed semantic graph                                   | SQL-based link table                           |
| **Context Awareness**    | Emotion, attention, energy, location                         | Largely absent                                 |
| **AI Integration**       | Built-in inference, summarization, vector linking            | Mentioned as future extension                  |


In short, LifeOS treats your life not as a static archive but as a **semantic, narrative-rich, evolving stream of consciousness**‚Äîfueled by data and made meaningful through AI.

### ü§ñ AI Processing
- Serverless pipelines using **AWS Lambda / Step Functions**
- Function calls to **OpenAI API** for summarization, classification, and link generation
- Caching of recent inferences in **Redis**
- Semantic linking and retrieval using **Pinecone + Neo4j**

---

## üõ† Backend Architecture (MVC + MCP Ready)

LifeOS uses a clean **MVC-style backend**, extended to support:

- **Router ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí Service** layers for clean separation
- A **Context** module passed through all operations (user, emotion, energy, attention, source)
- Optional **Protocols** for orchestrating reusable workflows (journal reflection, file upload, event linking)

This makes it **MCP-compatible** in the future: enabling LifeOS to expose or consume standardized external data through **MCP clients and servers**.
